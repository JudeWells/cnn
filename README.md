Other ML algorithms to test (on the spectrum features):

 - XGboost
 - Random Forest (sklearn)
 - Feed-forward neural network (pytorch)

## using a neural network on the raw data
we want to build a 1D CNN in pytorch
For this you will need to build a different dataset, with the raw data, and the labels.
